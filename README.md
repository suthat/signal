## Signal 

Signal is a framework for multiple consumers notification service. It was found, designed, and developed at School of Information Technology, KMUTT (Thailand) or SIT (http://www.sit.kmutt.ac.th)

> Users are beginning to rely on notifications, both in their private and working lives. Real-time messages deliver up-to-the-minute direct to users’ mobile phones, tablets, cameras , watches, glasses, or desktops. (F. Wilson. “Mobile Notifications”. A VC musings of a VC in NYC (1st March 1 2011) http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/03/mobile-notifications.html)

#### Problems of existed notifications

* It ends up with different notifications on different devices.
* Less feedback (most of them have only ack, status).
* Commercial Licenses (mostly, for service costs and financial).

#### Solutions

* Design and propose notification description, notification mapping and notification query language. Notification languages allow any provider to delivers messages to multiple types of user’s devices.
* Design notification languages’ parsers with a built-in real-time notification service, this will propose customizable notification and feedback languages with their parsers including the real-time scheduling service.
* Develop an opensource framework for multiple-consumers notification service and contribute new software to opensource community for getting collaboration improvement with other developers. 

#### Propose of Notification Languages ####

* Notification Description Language (NDL)

It will describes notification data, feedback, realtime conditions, channels, devices, etc. in a single standard format.

* Notification Query Language (NQL)

It will uses for retrieving notification data, status and its feedback.  

* Notification Mapping Language (NML)

It will uses for mapping notification data and feedback from different protocols to NDL.
